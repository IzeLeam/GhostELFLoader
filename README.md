# üß† ISOS Loader ‚Äì Advanced Dynamic ELF Loader with In-Memory Decryption & Obfuscation

ISOS Loader is a **custom dynamic ELF loader** designed to demonstrate advanced low-level programming concepts such as binary loading, symbol resolution, runtime decryption, and anti-static analysis techniques.

This project showcases deep expertise in:
- ELF internals & memory mapping
- Custom PLT/GOT mechanics
- In-memory loading with runtime decryption
- Runtime obfuscation to protect shared libraries

## üöÄ Features

### üîß Custom ELF Loader
- Parses ELF headers & program segments manually.
- Loads segments into memory and applies correct memory protections.
- Applies relocations and resolves both imported and exported symbols dynamically.

### üßÆ Custom PLT/GOT Implementation
- Implements its own Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) and Global Offset Table (GOT).
- Caches resolved symbol addresses in the GOT for optimized repeated function calls.
- Fully bypasses standard dynamic linker (`ld.so`).

### üõ° Runtime Library Encryption / Decryption
- Encrypts shared libraries using **XOR encryption** (fast & simple).
- Decrypts libraries **directly into memory** using `memfd_create()` for stealth.
- Supports secure passing of decryption key via command-line.

### üïµÔ∏è Obfuscation & Anti-Analysis
- Entire libraries are **never stored unencrypted on disk**.
- Prevents static analysis by decrypting at runtime only.
- Leaves **zero trace** of the actual shared object on the file system.

### üñ• Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Load encrypted or plaintext ELF shared libraries.
- Specify one or more functions to call dynamically.
- Enable verbose output for step-by-step debug information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîê 1. Library Encryption
A shared object (`.so`) is XOR-encrypted with a secret key:
```bash
./encrypt lib/libfoo.so lib/libfoo.so.enc "my_secret_key"
```

### üß† 2. Custom ELF Loading
At runtime:
- The encrypted `.so` is decrypted into memory.
- The loader parses the ELF structure, loads segments, and performs relocations.
- A custom PLT/GOT is used to resolve symbols.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Runtime Execution
- Functions specified via command line are resolved and called.
- No trace is left on disk thanks to `memfd_create()`.

## üõ† Usage

### üîí Encrypt a Shared Library
```bash
./encrypt lib/libfoo.so lib/libfoo.so.enc "my_secret_key"
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Loader
```bash
./isos_loader -k "my_secret_key" lib/libfoo.so.enc foo_exported bar_exported
```

### üêû Verbose Mode (Debugging)
```bash
./isos_loader -v -k "my_secret_key" lib/libfoo.so.enc foo_exported bar_exported
```
