# ISOS Loader â€” Dynamic ELF loader for offensive security research

**ISOS Loader** is a research-focused dynamic ELF loader implemented to support controlled experimentation in low-level offensive security techniques, in-memory payload handling and anti-analysis evaluation. The repository is designed as a lab platform for red-team/blue-team exercises, defensive research and academic study under strict, authorized conditions.

## Purpose

This project provides a safe, auditable environment to study behaviors related to runtime loading, symbol resolution and protected in-memory execution of shared objects. Its primary goals are:

* To enable reproducible experiments that measure detection surface and mitigation effectiveness;
* To provide a modular framework for testing loader internals and alternative symbol resolution mechanisms;
* To support the development and evaluation of defensive countermeasures against in-memory-only threats.

> **Warning:** Use only in isolated, authorized testbeds. This project is not intended for malicious activities.

## Overview

ISOS Loader implements mechanisms to materialize and execute protected shared objects in memory while minimizing persistent artifacts. The design emphasizes modularity, observability and reproducibility for research purposes.

Core research themes:

* ELF internals and segment mapping
* Relocation and runtime linking behaviors
* Alternative PLT/GOT strategies and symbol caching
* Interactions between in-memory payloads and endpoint detection tools

## Key capabilities

* **Manual ELF handling (research grade)**

  * Inspect and map ELF headers and segments; apply appropriate memory protections and relocations without relying on the system dynamic linker.

* **Custom symbol resolution & caching**

  * Experiment with PLT/GOT semantics and caching strategies to measure performance and tracing implications for monitoring systems.

* **Protected in-memory payload workflow (research abstraction)**

  * Support a workflow where payloads are stored encrypted at rest and materialized only within controlled memory regions for execution, to study detection and forensic implications.

* **Instrumentation and telemetry**

  * Provide hooks for logging, tracing and sandboxed execution to compare observable behaviors across configurations.

* **Modular architecture**

  * Clear separation between parsing, mapping, relocation, resolution and execution to facilitate unit testing and targeted experiments.

## Intended research scenarios

ISOS Loader is a laboratory tool intended to support the following scenarios:

* Authorized red-team exercises where actions are monitored and constrained by rules of engagement.
* Blue-team detection research to benchmark host and network sensors against in-memory techniques.
* Academic studies of loader internals and mitigation effectiveness.
* Forensic research to design techniques that detect or reconstruct in-memory-only payload execution.

## Build & test (high level)

The repository includes a conventional build system and a test harness designed for safe execution in an isolated environment. Recommended high-level steps:

1. Prepare an isolated test environment (VM or container) with a minimal toolchain and network isolation.
2. Build the project using the provided build scripts and toolchain instructions.
3. Run unit and integration tests that exercise loader components under controlled inputs and validate observable artifacts.

Do not run experiments on production systems or without explicit authorization from system owners.

## Security and ethical considerations

* Use exclusively in isolated, consensual testbeds with clear rules of engagement.
* Maintain thorough documentation of experiments and retain logs for post-exercise analysis.
* Avoid deployment on production infrastructure or third-party systems.
* The maintainer disclaims responsibility for malicious use; contributors must follow the project safety policy.

## Contributing & governance

Contributions are welcome under the following rules:

* All contributions must include a clear purpose statement and test cases demonstrating intended behavior in an isolated environment.
* Pull requests touching sensitive capabilities must include risk assessment and mitigation notes.
* The maintainers reserve the right to reject changes that increase misuse risk without sufficient safeguards.
